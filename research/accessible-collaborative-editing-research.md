# Best Practices for Accessible Real-Time Collaboration

Project title: Best Practices for Accessible Real-Time Collaboration 
Intern: Swast
Mentor:  Mars Lee and Isabela Presedo-Floyd
Start and end date: January 24 - April 22

## Project context and goals

[Real-time collaborative editing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_real-time_editor) 
(sometimes abbreviated at RTC) is becoming increasingly popular among web applications, 
open-source and otherwise. While RTC practices are regularly being improved, current approaches 
often lack [accessibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility#Web_accessibility) and 
user experience considerations. Efforts to design improved RTC experiences have revealed a lack 
of open, public research and recommendations on desirable experiences, even less so with the 
feedback of disabled users. As people who build tools in the open for use globally, it is our 
responsibility to make work that is inclusive of people with a range of abilities as well as 
create the resources for others to do so.

We aim to address this absence by exploring existing RTC practices, accessibility guidelines, 
and overlapping research— both successful and unsuccessful approaches — in order to propose 
best practices from a user-experience perspective. This proposal will include both text-based 
guidelines and illustrative examples of UX/UI implementing the best practices.The intern will 
guide the research approaches and scope. Auditing the accessibility of other RTC editors may 
also prove helpful. If there is interest and time, direct user research will also be used. 

Intended outcomes for the internship:
- A document combining the proposed best practices, research methods, and illustrative 
examples used throughout the internship. This document will be published and shared with at 
least one open source project.
- A blog post on the Quansight Labs blog announcing this document and reflecting on what the 
intern learned as an individual.
- A demo/discussion of the work during a Qshare (a meeting for everyone in the company who is 
interested to share things they've learned).
- Mentorship and guidance from members of open source and accessibility communities. This will 
also be an opportunity to learn about contributing to and the review process in open source projects.

## Proposed Approach

The accessible RTC best practices will be researched, explored, and recommended by the 
intern with the guidance of the mentors. Exploration and discussion will be done via 
collaborative documents, while the final document and publication location will be decided 
based on the research. The report itself must be accessible.
