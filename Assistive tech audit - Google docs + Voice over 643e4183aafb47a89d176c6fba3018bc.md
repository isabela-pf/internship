# Assistive tech audit - Google docs + Voice over

## Notes:

1. Most of the keyboard commands were easy to use because of **Tab and Enter** keys
2. The list of keyboard shortcuts provided on the list and on internet is **NOT at all feasible** to remember and apply, only the important ones can be remembered

### Notes on screen readers

1. The screen reader assistive tech provided on google docs is not working, at least on my computer
2. Outsourcing screen readers is itself making the RTC tool not suitable for accessibility - fails on the first place

**Tried possible solutions to make it work:**

1. Extensions - working on their own but this is an audit for Google Docs
2. Followed exact steps given on the google docs support & help
3. Turning on Microphone permissions - after reading other resources and failing with every possible options, I recently figured the problem might be that I havenâ€™t granted Google Docs permissions to use microphone, but the voice typing works and not the screen reader.

### VoiceOver Keyboard Shortcuts notes:

Almost full screen can be navigated with VO + Arrow keys

Accessibility options on google docs, *but how do we navigate on this?*

NVDA Audit: all of verbal reading and no important or output focused assistance. Used mouse to click on the comments section- it said the comments out loud
